# F1-Telemetry
This personal project aimed to generate telemetry plots to compare F1 drivers during qualifying. 
The drivers' datas are available on the F1 App, I used py-tesseract (OCR) to read frame by frame the speed and created a log for one lap. 
Once the logs are generated, I can easily plot them using matplotlib. 

See F1 Telemetry Process.pdf for the process chart.
